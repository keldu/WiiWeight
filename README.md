# WiiWeight
Short input code which processes the wii balance board input and calculates a bad estimate of weight with the simplest possible kalman filter.  

Currently just an upload of old hacky code done over the weekend on a congress.  
Calibration was done at one weight point with another scale,  
so it really isn't calibrated.  

Compile with 'gcc wiiweight.c -o wiiweight'. It's not that hard.
